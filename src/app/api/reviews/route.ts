          text: 'I am writing this review some months after dealing with Lions Gate. I selected Lions Gate after seeing all of the positive reviews online.   After all, who gets ALL 5 star reviews??\n\nSometimes reviews are manipulated and deceptive, but these guys are the real deal!!   They arrived right on time, calling 10 minutes in advance to alert us of their arrival.  They identified the door issue within minutes and had all of the necessary parts to execute an effective repair.   The price quoted was awesome.\n\nI was suitably impressed and asked if they could take a look at a couple of other garage doors I had in another building.  Their response "Sure, we still have time on this call to take a look".  They looked, said things were good, did some lubrication and the doors are running better than ever.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of changing maintenance companies on a bi-yearly basis I have found a *great* company that I plan ion using as long as they are around!\n\nI would give them 6 stars if I could.',

From my initial email requesting a quote, to the individual who answered my call, to the rep who scheduled my service and the service tech (Harry), everything was fantastic and delivered with professionalism and a pleasant manner. Had them in to repair a cable on townhouse garage door and the cost was fair (my other quote came in well over $100 higher), the repair was fast and easy and even payment was efficient and convenient. Won’t hesitate to use them again and refer others. Thank you again!',
